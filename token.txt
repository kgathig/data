The services provided by Comcast are ridiculous. You pay lots of money for no adequate service. Everything keeps dropping from the cable to the internet to the phone on important calls. It takes hours to get the customer support. Called them just to find out you need yet another technician out here and have to call back again for credit for the time and services you have lost. Do yourself a favor and go with another company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2
Ordered a Comcast bundle. After they quoted and approved me and hooked it all up. They charged me with someone else's bill for 1397.40 on top of my bill for 367.68. Then Comcast disconnected it. They did not even notified me that they added someone else's account for 2008 to mine. I have contacted several people in their offices and been told to bring in a death certificate for this other person or the Comcast property they had. How am I suppose to do that?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
This is the 2nd time Comcast/XFINITY has STOLEN money off my credit card. They took 2 payments a week apart. And try to give me attitude when I demand it back, then had the nerve to tell me it would take 3weeks to put it back on my card! Worst Company Ever! Moving to another!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1
I signed up for Comcast TV and Internet package for 6 months and I called and cancelled the TV portion and kept the internet in March of 2013. Well, the TV was never taken off my account and I was charged for 2 months of TV service that I never used at $145+. On top of that, our internet wants to work when it feels like it. Our cell phone bills have been double b/c we are being charged for data usage when we think we are connected to WiFi in our townhouse. I called the customer service line and was put on hold for 45 minutes. Then I asked to speak with someone that could maybe troubleshoot our internet issues. The guys told me that Comcast doesn't provide the Modem when internet is installed so now I have a modem that was broken from the beginning. I opened my bill for this month and mind you, I should only be charged around $70 for just the internet and my bill was $304.45... I was LIVID. I called the service number back again and asked to speak to a supervisor... I was put on hold for over an hour and then they said they would call me back within two hours. I never got a phone call. I called again the following day and was put on hold for 38 minutes and was told the same thing, someone would call me back. So with the amount of frustration I had, I just hung up. I finally contacted someone in the corporate office and I do have to say they were very helpful. I know how important customer service is. Speaking from experience, I just cannot believe how horrible the service is at Comcast. So today, I am cancelling my account and I'm not paying my last bill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1
We have a $300 cable bill and called to lower it. I spent over an hour on the phone with them (after waiting on hold for 20 minutes). I finally agreed to a $99.00 double play. TV and internet. We got rid of the landline. We got our bill but no change! I called them to find out what happened and the billing lady says there was a mistake made and I have to go back to the sales team. I was fuming! On hold again for 20 minutes! They wouldn't honor the agreement!! I asked to talk to management and she said the only thing they could do is email the manager and she said she would make sure she called today. It never happened! They never called. The worst customer service ever!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1
Paying for over 100 mbps bandwidth... Getting less than 20 mbps and that's in the best place. I tested all over the (small) house getting down to about .2 mbps in the worst place. Comcast robs their customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1
The rep who handled my claim put my office building address down as my service address even though I told them the correct address multiple times. So when technicians arrived on install date they refused to install since wrong service address was on file. They also had all of the wrong equipment and were prepared to install the incorrect cable package (the rep and I agreed to a different one). So I was told to go to a Comcast service center and when you call there you are once again dealing with a automated system that directs you to more CS reps. Not anyone at the actual location so I can't be professional and set up a appointment. So now I run the risk of not being able to talk to anyone about my issue when I go into the service center. I HAVE NEVER DEALT WITH A MORE PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE SYSTEM IN MY LIFE. Is passing elementary school the only prerequisite for becoming a customer service rep at Comcast? Putting down a correct address would seem to be a pretty high priority but I guess that's too much to ask for. If my mother hadn't run up a 600 dollar debt from AT&T in my name when I was 19, I would have went with them days ago. Truly a horrible experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1
For 5 years now I have had problems with my cable modem rebooting all the time (ALL cable modems I have used. I am up to 4 now). I called Comcast out 5 or 6 times and they could not find a problem anywhere. Still I have 5 to 6 months out of the year where I am getting disconnecting 6 to 10 times per hour. This company really does suck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1
First off trying to use their automated phone system to try to talk to someone is just messed up. It hung up on me over 8 times before I could finally talk to someone. Then when you talk to someone they are real idiots as other reviews say. Then after talking to them I had to call someone else because they would not transfer me and that automated system is just as bad. Then I get another idiot that can't help me that I have to give them my information so someone can call me back in 12 to 24 hours. This whole process took over an hour just to find out someone will call me back in 12 to 24 hours. Really I am trying to get something tooken care of today not 24 HOURS FROM NOW. DO NOT GET SERVICE WITH THIS COMPANY.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1
I researched for Comcast on the internet and then called Comcast to speak to a representative. I told her the services I wanted and ask what Comcast had to offer in my area as a new customer. I was given a bundle package for television and internet for $79.99 a month, with the total monthly fee of $103.00 after taxes & fees were added with a 2-year agreement. I was also to receive a $250.00 Visa gift card as a bonus for signing up for the bundle deal. I agreed to allow Comcast to become my service provider based on this agreement. The Comcast representative emailed me a very detailed summary showing all services I would receive and a breakdown of all monthly charges. Based on this information, I allowed their equipment to be installed in my home. After the installation, I asked the installer about how I would receive my first bill and my Visa gift card. He was clueless but said I should just call 1 800 Comcast. I called and spoke to another Comcast representative who told me not to worry, I would receive my first bill in the mail in a few days. Almost two weeks later, I received a bill for over $136.00 instead of the $103.00 that I had in writing. I checked the bill carefully to see if it was extra charges for more the one month, it was NOT. I called Comcast yet again and explained my experience in great detail. I was asked to forward them my email with my offer which I did while on the phone with them. I was told that it would be no problem to change my bill to the price I was offered, they were just having difficulty adjusting the account and would take care of it within 24 hours. I was called back later that day and told that they would NOT honor the agreement that they made with me because their representative was using outdated equipment and gave me a package that no longer existed. I spent quite some time on the phone with Comcast, including speaking to supervisors. I was told the only way I could keep my services was to agree to pay a higher price for same package which was $40.00 more a month from my written offer. I ask the supervisor to email me the information he was telling me over the phone so that I would have the information in writing. He told me that he had no way of sending an email to me! I ask him to have a representative or service provider to remove their equipment from my home. He told me they would NOT send anyone to remove the equipment, I would have to do it myself. So now I am left with a decision, remove and return equipment myself or pay their extortion fees. In my opinion, this is a clear case of FRAUD and unfair business practices. Be careful if you choose to do business with this company!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1
We have been unable to access Comcast's On Demand services for over 6 months. We have had several technicians come to the house, and have had everything replaced from the box to the street. However, no one from Comcast has ever gone beyond the pedestal in our front yard to find and fix the problem. Comcast is well aware of the problem, as I have called them several times. What in the world can be done other than changing my service to Direct TV? I have wasted time and have no credit issued to my account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
Cable, phone and internet installed last August. The first 30 days are free if your service was not good and it was not. We had 4-5 service orders, not resolved. I cancelled service within the 30 days and continued to get billed for service and labor charges. I called 3-4 times to CS and asked them to remove all charges because we were within 30 days, nothing happened, I gave up. My account is now in collections and has affected my credit score. It's been 7 months and Comcast needs to zero my account and correct all three credit bureaus. Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1
What happen - this has been a nightmare for months. I am still waiting for reps to call me back. I have called over 25 times. Each time I call, no one sees my former complaint. I have to start all over again. No one ever calls me back. No one can ever help me. I have been getting charged for equipment and packages I did not ask for. I am owed Credits - and they refuse to give them to me. BEWARE AND DO NOT GET COMCAST. They lie to you!! They change your package without you knowing. Do not choose Comcast. You will need another job to pay for their service - they are thieves!! Customer service reps are trained to rip you off! They add to bill without your consent. They work off commission! Someone need to start a class action lawsuit!! I am owed hundreds of dollars for being lied to and charged for service I did not have.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1
Tried to pay my bill on Saturday. Was not able to access account online. Got a message my email address wasn't connected to the account. So I called waiting over a hour to make payment. I gave up. Made payment through my bank online. Well they didn't get it fast enough, shut my cable off, charged me fees, and I called today 2-8. After 3 transfers and 45 min later I got my service back on. I was asked 3 times how I sent the money. They are a monopoly. I hate them and there is no other provider allowed in my area. It is so horrible the way they treat their customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1
Xfinity (Comcast) increased my monthly charge without noticing me, and the internet becomes unusable (several disconnects per night). After I contact the customer service, they are willing to refund me for only less than half of the overcharged part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1
I am extremely upset with the ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE that I have received from Comcast since we agreed [now, regrettably] to sign up with them back in June 2013. They have billed me incorrectly every month over-charging at least $15/month and then it takes hours of frustration calling them to demand a credit be applied to the account. The Customer Service Agent that I speak to always says that they have the authority to apply the small credits, but they do not appear on my billing statement the following month. Then when I call back, the next agent claims that there is no record that I called in and no record that a credit was to be applied to the account. One time a credit was approved but was later over-turned by someone else who had no contact with me. This is a terrible company to deal with, and I recommend to any potential new cable customers that if you have another alternative then you should go with the other company. However, I have dealt with DirecTV and Dish, and they are all terrible. I previously had internet through AT&T U-verse, and we received decent [not great] service from them at least they were not blatantly dishonest like Comcast has treated me.Comcast seems incapable of billing me correctly, and every month I have a $15 increase [with no explanation] in my monthly service. Also, we had a continual problem with slow internet - don't believe their hype about cable internet speed. The U-verse broadband was way faster, could handle more devices, and was consistently much more reliable! Comcast "offered" to send a tech out at no charge and to the guy's credit when he left, the internet has performed much better, but of course the idiots in Comcast billing dept added a $60 charge for the visit to my bill - which I refuse to pay!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1
This is an example of how Comcast have left their installation at **, Savannah. Open to the weather and to any passing trouble maker. Total disgrace. Several attempts have been made for Comcast to fix this but no reaction. A poor statement of quality and will no doubt lead to service issues for the many customers.

I spoke with Comcast 4/10, agreed to a new promotion. I repeated several times my total bill amount asking for confirmation that that is what it would be. The customer rep agreed several times. I received my bill today it is $100.00 more! I had been leery because of so many issues in the past. I called to discuss the billing discrepancy. I had the rep's name, employee #, and all facts written as stated to me, and one of the 2 people that were witness to my speaker phone conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1
Sales people and TV people have stated that if you subscribe to cable you will not need the box. Well thats not altogether true.  If you have basic cable without a cable box, you are forced to buy a more expensive service that includes a cable box.  I dont wont or need the extra benefits of this more expensive services all I want is basic cable.  Cable is expensive enough without being forced to purchase the more expensive service having to monthly rent the box from the cable company.  No one can tell me if I purchase the box from Best Buy will that make my TV work with the very basic cable service.  And now that I face having to buy something I cant use or have replaced my expired coupon.I must now upgrade my service and pay an additional monthly charge for the rest of my life for something I don't want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1
On 12/17/2014 I contacted Comcast with the request to discontinue service on account #** effective 2/1/2015. On 12/18/2014 I received their response that there was an agreement with the expiration date of 2/1/2016. They stated that if I discontinue services prior to the expiration date they will file a law suit against my property. After that I requested a copy of the agreement and received such on 1/5/15. The agreement was written on 07/02/2006 between Comcast and Rewatt Inc., which a previous owner of my facility. My company, Integrated-1 Corp., purchased the property from Rewatt Inc. where cable service was provided. The purchase occurred in May 2007. I kept DBA name Dornoch Place Del Prado because of brochures and sign on the property. I never knew about contract and been paying on monthly basics for cable services. All statement from Comcast were coming in DBA name, and I was not aware that there was any contract and that the Rewatt Inc. was still attached to it. During the past few years, Comcast has increased its service prices repeatedly (from $15.26 per contract to $28.73 per unit). At this time, it is double the original amount I have to pay. I found more affordable provider, which is RetirementHomeTV with 5 years fix rate $12.38 per unit. Comcast representative referring me to Section 14 Assignability of the agreement between them and company, which have nothing to do with me. This paragraph states that the contract automatically rolls over onto the successors. It further states that 90 day notice of change must be filed. I have never received any notices from Comcast or Rewatt Inc. about their agreement, no representative has contacted me ever, and it is illegal for someone to sign me up for an obligation without my personal agreement. Comcast trying to make me responsible for someone else's obligation illegally. Proposed solution: we can enter into a new contract with Comcast if they can offer us competitive prices or they need to disconnect their services without any harassment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1
I have Comcast internet service and have been fairly happy with it until recently.  Approximately 50% of the time that I attempt to access my email through their website, I receive an error message saying my login failed.  I have had at least a dozen phone calls with Comcast techs and nothing they suggest cures the problem.  In fact, since I started complaining about it, the problems have actually increased to the point where there are entire days that I am unable to access my email due to this issue.  Although I have repeatedly complained to Comcast they have repeatedly failed to address this issue at all!  They tell me it is a problem with ME -- oh, please!  How difficult is it to access your email?  Also this occurs while I am actually reading my email at times -- it will suddently crash and I can not access it again until many hours and too may attempts later.  Comcast Customer Service is a joke.  They do not care at all if you have difficulties and they make absolutely no attempt to fix anything that isn't easily fixable. I have lost many hours of productive work time in attemtpting to remedy this problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1
I am a Comcast residential customer, fresh off several phone calls with two different Comcast reps in Billing and, thirdly, a supervisor. The reason I originally called is to inquire about contract renewal pricing, given that I am at the end of my original 12 month promo pricing as of this month. The first two reps insisted I signed up for a "2 year contract" when I initially established my service in Jan 2014. I said I wasn't aware of this, that I had no record or recollection of anything beyond a 12-month promotional rate period. When I insisted they provide me evidence of this, the first representative gave me a non-working internet link to follow "on my own" to see the terms of my agreement. I hung up and attempted to find the material, to no avail. I called back, and the second rep, "Geraldo", said he could not send or direct me to anything, it was just "what we have in our records." He further indicated the notes from the first rep reflected that TODAY I signed up for a new 2-year agreement. Whoa??? I asked him to ID the name of the first rep I spoke with, said "he didn't leave his name" on the note. (As if the system doesn't record that?!) I very pointedly insisted on a supervisor, was told none was available. (Actually it is believable there are no supervisors of these people.) Eventually after 5 minutes of insisting, I was transferred to Rafael in the "escalation department."First off I asked Rafael what is going on in the notes, why the first rep would make such a misrepresentation and why no-one could send or direct me to written evidence of a so-called 2-yr contract. Rafael kept changing the subject, instead tried to find me better pricing, though he could not. So, just to see, I asked Rafael to confirm the contract termination date in their system. THE PUNCHLINE... Rafael conceded I was NOT UNDER A CONTRACT, THAT I WAS PAYING MONTH TO MONTH. I asked why the first two representatives flat out told me I was, Rafael said he did not know, "perhaps they had the wrong information." I am inclined to believe Rafael, both because he shares my understanding, and further he is at a separate call center likely not "in" on the angle of trying to convince customers of nonexistent contract terms.So, today I had two Comcast reps TELL ME FLAT OUT LIES in order to protect their non-promo pricing and/or keep me from switching. More amazingly there are droves of internet posts that I find going back years on this same theme; either Comcast management doesn't read the feedback, doesn't care, or encourages this sort of thing. All three are reasons not to do business with this fraud of a company. I am cancelling my service, and plan to broadcast far and wide online of my above account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1
Am a new customer. I called to get Internet service to my new house, the person who talked to me was not professional and didn't show any respect and was not even listen to me. When I asked him to please listen to me first, he said "go ahead and I will pretend listening!!!" He told me his ID is ** which I think it is a lie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1
This should have been a 5 minute process. I should have been able to send a simple email to the Comcast customer service group requesting that my service be turned off at the end of this month. But Comcast does not conduct business via email, so I decided to give their poor chat session a try to see if that would fulfill my needs. Needless to say, it did not. The poor girl was so poorly trained, that I thought that she might have a serious problem with the English language or was possibly dyslexic. Every time I would send a question her way, she would either ignore it, or give me a answer that had nothing to do with my question. Eventually I gave up and when I attempted to print out the entire conversation so I could actually post it here, I could only get the first page of the conversation to print out. Unbelievable. So you will have to trust me when I say that Comcast is quite possibly the worst cable provider on the face of the earth and please do not use them if you can avoid them. I had to use them as they were the only provider in my apartment community in Lynchburg VA.I would also like for everyone to know that even getting into a chat session on a Sunday morning at approximately 11:00 a.m. also took several attempts on my part. The browser states that your chat will begin shortly but after waiting over 10 minutes watching the stupid little lines spin, and spin, and then spin some more, I jumped out and tried to get back in via a different topic. After about 2 more minutes of spinning lines, I finally got the most incompetent representative ever in my 60 years of life on planet earth. Bottom line. If you can avoid Comcast I would highly recommend it. I will not try to point you in a direction towards any other cable provider, but if I can get at least 1 family/person not to sign up with Comcast I feel that this endeavor was worth my time and effort. Can one voice make a difference? YES IT CAN.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
I called to get help with an internet modem wireless signal loss. Comcast placed a wireless modem in my house for me. We are constantly losing wireless signal. I called to find out what to do and was told that I had to pay to talk with a technical expert. I pay $150.00 per month for service and they want me to pay to talk to a technician. I asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor called me back and was extremely rude and made veiled threats about disconnecting my service. I hung up on the supervisor. This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The issue is still unresolved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1
Been a customer since 2011 on automatic payment. My credit card expired. They cancel my service without a notification that after been a loyal customer until Sept 2015 am no longer on automatic payment. Looking for another provider that cares about their business and appreciate loyal customers. After talking to so many customer service agents both in Spanish and English and one manager in Spanish who was so unprofessional. His name Cristian ** and another customer service agent name Wayne.

I scheduled a technician to come out and install two high definition DVR's and progrm them so I could get my cable service upgraded to the new requirements of Comcast.  The technician came out and hooked up the two DVR's and "programmed" them.  I had to call customer service three times after his visit to have the DVR's reprogrammed because the on screen TV Guide would not work.Approximately one week later, I had a technician come out to replace a burnt out Internet modem and while there, he checked out the DVR's and found that they had not been programmed correctly.  The "On Demand" option was also not working.  I also discovered that the first technician did not hook up the epuipemnt properly.  I had replaced four VCR's and an old cable converter box with the two DVR's.  He had not removed any of the extra cabling, but had just used one of the five cables and associated hardware to hook up the DVR's.I then had to undo all of the cables, properly wire up the DVR's and remove the extra cable items.  I contacted the cable company and was told to contact my local office as this was not their problem.  The local office has no phone number access, and I am not able, at this time, to physically go in to file a complaint.  I was charged $51.99 for services rendered in an unsatisfactory manner and would like to be reimbursed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1
Three channels were deleted from my cable service with little notice and no reduction in fees -- Oxygen, Hallmark, and  MSNBC. I watched all 3 a good deal, particularly MSNBC. I want those channels back, without having to pay ADDITIONAL fees for a converter box. One of the main points of conversion 2009 plan from analog to digital is that if one does NOT receive TV over airwaves, but via a cable, converter boxes are NOT needed. Comcast's moving of these 3 channels to the all digital subscription plan is simply a bait'n'switch sort of business gimmick to try and get me to buy a higher priced plan. I had a contract with Comcast when I signed on that included these 3 channels, and I want them back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1
I asked Customer Service about reducing my bill. When I asked about removing one of my services, I was told that my bill would increase substantially because I would no longer be eligible for the Triple Play discount (even though new customers would only pay a fraction of the cost quoted to me). I questioned whether they would rather lose my business, an existing customer, than get a new customer. Eventually, I was given a $15 discount for the next 12 months. On the subsequent bill, I had a $5 charge for making a change. I called back and said that I did not make a change and they said that I was offered a $15 per month discount and they considered that a chance. I asked for the $5 to be removed and the rep said that he could not remove it. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and he put me on hold for 30 minutes!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1

I don't have room for the detailed summary (it's 4 pages single spaced). We've been without cable for almost a month - multiple technicians and phone calls each telling us they promised to resolve our issue (1st technician never showed up despite us waiting for 2 hours then being told he'd be there within another hour). Total amount of OUR time spent (I started keeping track AFTER first missed appt) so this is on the low end: 17.5 hours waiting or at home with technicians and over 7.5 hours on the phone (calculated based upon cell phone records). This doesn't include multiple calls from my husband.Ultimately, they discovered the box they gave us was the problem. 20 minute install of new box, WOW it works now. Oh, and by the way - couldn't get any kind of response until we filed FCC Complaint. While that initially got corporate's attention - but even they didn't call back when they promised (and of course, they don't give YOU a number - heaven forbid you actually have the ability to call them).NOW, they want to make sure to compensate us for our troubles. I sent them the 4 pager. They agreed what we went through was awful and credited us a WHOLE month of cable - and then act like they're doing US a favor (by the way, did I fail to mention that we DIDN'T HAVE CABLE for most of the month). But wait, they threw in internet. $55 more dollars. SO generous. I guess according to COMCAST $55 is fair compensation for over 25 hours of their customer's time that could have been resolved in 20 minutes. Absolutely HORRIBLE excuse for customer service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1
Comcast offered me a deal that was going to cost me a one time fee of $60 for installation, and $60 a month for service. I agreed to this and 2 weeks later I'm being billed for $250 with all these added monthly fees... Currently I'm disputing the charges. Comcast's agent lied to me and promised these prices that he seems to have just made up. There is no accountability and getting through the phone support is a nightmare. This makes me sick to my stomach and is extremely frustrating. Shame on Comcast for running a business like this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1
Hello everyone. I have been a Comcast customer for the past 4 years. Comcast has great services but don't work good with its customers. I recently go divorced and had to take the service with me. I could no longer afford the services I previously had with them and I called them to see if they were able to help me. The representative told me he would help me get a deal to help. I ended up with a package that cost $40 more and at first I thought maybe it's the startup cost. So I finally got my new bill and that was the new price. So I call them and let them know. They told me there was nothing they could do. I'm stuck paying the new price and on top of that they gave me a new 2 year contract. So now to cancel, they want me to pay close to $1000.00 to leave their company.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1
After 3 years of loyalty and 7 months of trying to get special pricing to lower my bill I had decided to leave Comcast as I got a much better deal with a satellite TV company. I called Comcast to advise them I needed my service turned off. They advised me I would have a $29.95 fee to send a tech to put a filter on my line. I asked to speak to a manager, who informed me, the same. I asked where it is stated they will charge this if you cancel. I was advised that it is not in writing but is available on some channel on their cable station. I think this is terrible service. I will never use them again. I will be writing to the company- but also posting all over the social network sites. I am so appalled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1
Mid June, I called to have service transferred for Beginning of July. Service transferred, however they did not transfer phone. After many many many calls and long waiting time on hold, and rude customer service My phone was transferred, with the wrong number. Now I had to start the process over again. FINALLY after repeated calls and waiting, number switched back to previous number. NOW around 8/3, somehow my telephone number switched back to the number THEY gave me when I moved. When I called about MY number the representative who I could understand asked, who was the carrier. Uhmmm COMCAST. I was promised this would be corrected on 8/5. Today 8/7, same promises. Many file #s to reference, still I do not have my correct telephone number. COMCAST provides the worst service. If I can take MY number with me to another carrier, I AM OFFICIALLY DONE WITH COMCAST!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1
For well over a year I have been experiencing poor signal problems. After 4 technicians and 2 sub-contractors we are still paying a premium for a service that we do not have.  Customer service is a joke.  They are unable to even locate our account in their system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1
Comcast bottlenecks my internet if I use too much bandwith. They never provide me with the speed I pay for which happens to be their top speed. They make me go through the same tests every time they purposely slow my internet connection. First, they told me it was my splitter, so I bought a new one. Then they told me it was my router, so I bought a new one. Then they told me it is because I am not using their router, which they never offered before until recently?! After I got rid of cable TV and returned my box with remote, got rid of the splitter, they still charge me every month for the cable box. I called numerous times, one person even said he would take the charges off. They never did. They said they would research it and never got back to me either. This was over a year ago. Every time I tell them, this only happens when we all play games or live stream on the internet. They deny it has anything to do with them and say it's my modem and or router or am I using a splitter. We can have a tech come. Somehow, our internet works perfect as long as we just use it for browsing or checking emails. They lie about the advertisement too, I pay for their best connection and was told we could all play online games with no interruption by their sales lady who claims to have been a former AT&T employee. I was told this when I told them I was fed up and going to AT&T.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1
I'm at my mother's house recovering from surgery. We lost cable, phone, and Internet last night at 10pm. They fixed the phone and cable. I got the Internet to work after 4 hours on the phone around 7am. It died before 6pm. I dealt with numerous rude sickos for 4 hours only to have them blame the problem on Vista, even though I never had problems until they started jacking with my settings.They refuse to put my mother's correct SS# on her account and they abuse her every time she has to call over that. They kept confusing us with another account, and telling us that it worked or that we didn't have wi-fi, like we're a couple of brain-damaged 5 year-olds. It worked for two hours, then died again. After being uncommonly evil, they told us that they couldn't get a tech guy out here for 86 hours. This is terrible.If it were their intention to be the worst, most evil, incompetent, sadistic company on this planet I can't think of a single thing they would be doing differently. Since they confused my mother's account with mine in another town (I'm here recovering from surgery) and they jacked with all my settings for 7 hours I know that when I get back home nothing will work there, either. So 8 hours on the phone with these psychopaths and everything is worse than when I first called. This is the 4th of the last 7 days that the Internet has gone out, and it will be another 4 before they get out here                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1
Getting calls from Comcast or making calls to Comcast makes me want to vomit! I'm a senior age 78 and wife 78, and we get all these phone calls soliciting services from Comcast. These calls cause us to get out of our chair or quit bathing or use other methods to get to the phone to listen to some uneducated robot go through a solicitation. Trying to get into your system to stop these calls is nearly impossible and requires sitting and listening to automated music and messages only to finally fall asleep or hang up. Your company really demands a competitive market or management with some with more than Burger King mentality. We, seniors, do not deserve to be abused this way which includes the loud advertisements when the sound automatically goes up so you have to get up and again, get the remote and shut the thing down or off. Your company has to have the worse public image of any company ever on the earth. I hope one day, management has the need to call their doctor and be put on hold while the nurse plays a message about all the surgeries and techniques they offer their patients and they can combine these treatments maybe to offer a brain transplant but offer that sweet music like your time is of no importance. Take heed. The customers have the last word and competition will correct this problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1
You have to haggle to get the right billing. They can add random charges to your bill, such as "HD fee". Rude customer service. If there are 4 people, all 4 living in the same area, having the same package and same start date; they would still get different billing. It all depends on which rep you talk to or how good you are at haggling. People are being too generous here with the "one star" rating. This company deserves a 0 and public humiliation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1
A month ago I talk to Apple at Comcast on how I can get all Disney channels. She tells me that I would have to upgrade my package to the Triple Play Starter. We spent over an hour by which she told me I needed a new modem as well. Ok, fine. I told her, by the end of the conversation, that I didn't have the channels I requested. She said I had to wait til I got my new modem and installed. Ok, got the modem, installed it, but still no Disney channels (which I was assured that my package included ALL Disney channels). I called again and spoke to George who said that it was an error on their part and he'll take care of it but give him 30 minutes. I gave him the whole day and no change. I then chatted with Korina yesterday who said she would take care of it. Oh, she did!!! She upgraded my package to the next level without my consent. All we wanted was one channel and to get that we have to pay $190 a month... Really?!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1
I have unlimited calling as it is a part of my cable package but I keep getting billed for domestic calls. I've been calling them every month since November 2014. They credit the charge but then I get a new charge the next month. Each time they remove they swear it shouldn't be on there, the next month & it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1
They lured me with a package deal, a fancy new box with high quality video and I wish I could go back to dish. Almost every day my box freezes and reboots in the middle of a show. Finally got frustrated enough to call and spent 42 minutes on hold. Determined to have my peace until I finally gave up. So disappointed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
I have been a customer for over several years and I have spent hundreds of dollars for service each month.  I have been without service since last week.  I was bounced around from agent to agent and supervisor to supervisor!  I have got unprofessional technicians entering my home with sarcastic, witty remarks and undesirable conversations.  I had been lied to about when the service will be restored since 9/8--it is now 9/13 and I still don't have any service.With all the customer service agents and supervisors that I have spoken with, they have granted me the "Comcast Customer Guarantee" credit.  I have been a customer for quite some time (over four years) and service was paid for every month!  I am contemplating about dropping them as a carrier and continue to report the employees for their lack of information representing Comcast and the unprofessional technicians that we allow into our homes.  Nothing has yet to be resolved on my end.  I am a very disgruntled paying customer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1
Tech Support has been telling me that the problem is with my hardware, browser or settings. I explained to them that it doesn't matter whether I use my work laptop while I'm working or desktop at home or an iPad. The computers have different browsers. All cookies and cache have been cleared, so those excuses are invalid as are all the other ones they keep telling me. I explained that co-workers and people outside of my company are all having the same problem with their Comcast email but this info doesn't seem to make any difference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1
This website should have negative stars available. I would give it negative 5. The only internet option for where we moved to was to use Comcast. We only wanted internet, no TV or phone. Upon trying to set up internet, we were trying to use a DOSIS 3.0 compatible modem we had used in the past. We called customer service who said they would have to send a technician out. I asked multiple times whether or not there would be a fee associated with the visit. I was told that the technician would let me know if there would be a fee associated with the work he would have to do. The technician came out and didn't make any mention of any fees that would be applied to my account. The only thing the technician did was use his modem to check that the connection was fine. This modem was apparently not compatible with Comcast, the technician recommended that we buy a new modem. So we bought a new modem as the technician said that was the only way to solve the problem. Upon receiving the new modem and a few calls to Comcast, the internet worked. A month later, I looked at my account and saw that I was being charged 85 dollars for the month, which is 40 dollars more than my plan costs. Looking into the detailed statement, I received a 40 dollar charge titled Customer Trouble Call after being told that there would be no fees associated with my troubles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1
My bill is so high, it is literally another house payment. I agreed for service in the amount of 159.99 every month with 10 dollars extra for other small cable boxes. We probably rent anywhere from 40 to 100 dollars in movies throughout the month (some are to buy that's why it is a high amount). I could not figure out why my bill was 800 dollars. Finally, I went into my local Comcast and had the manager literally walk me through charge by charge and payment by payment. Came to the conclusion that COMCAST bills you a month, sometimes a month and half ahead of time. So, I just called to find out how much I need to pay on Thursday. I must pay 385 for prior bill which I pay 380 dollars in Sept, but the bill was 765 so 385 carried over to this bill.I am so confused on why it is that high in the first place. They seem to dance around it when I am trying to understand. I can't pay that kind of money for Cable. That's insane. So I always just pay my past due. I am tired of not having a real reason as to why it is so extremely high. Anyways, so I have 385 due Thursday, then October's bill of 392 due on the 19th, THEN a new bill comes to me on the 24th (which is for Nov 3rd thru Dec. 4th). Why is the hell am I already being billed for months we aren't even in yet?They say, "It's for your convenience so you have it in advance and that's how the systems works." Well, I say it's because they want your balance to be high so your min. due is high which makes your past due high and most people can't pay that kind of money so they then get shut off and Comcast now get reactivation fees and late fees. I am appalled at them. I have gone through Comcast for about 15 yrs and they have become such scum. I am shocked. I wanted to write a review to inform people if they are struggling with their bill and can't understand why it is so high and where these fees are coming from, it is because they bill you for months that we aren't in yet! I really hope they change their "system". I am definitely ready to just go Netflix for good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1
Comcast has advertised free webcasting of NHL games, and they haven't been able to yet produce a single game. You talk with tech support and all they can offer is a nhl game package at the price of $169.00 dollar. No explanation for the false advertising of the benifit of having digital TV with the package of phone and internet for one price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1

Dvr box freezes and I've already received my 3rd bill after only one month of service. I feel like throwing this stupid x1 box out of my apartment window. I hate it. It's a ripoff... My bill is 170.00 a month for garbage cable service and no premium channels. I miss Cablevision. It was so much better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1
I tried for about 2 years to cancel Comcast commercial Internet account and switch to residential. Only after I complained to the BBB could I even get an employee who knew how to handle the situation. I wanted 1 year of refund of the difference in price. They offered 3 months, which in my view is them admitting they made the mistake in the first place.I was charged $210.88 every month, but should have been charged their residential rates of $50 or so. This went on for years. I was willing to settle for 1 year's refund.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1
I needed a new on demand box. Tried to order over the phone. I received 2 remotes which was not even the correct address. Tried calling again. This time I received 1 remote. Still no box. Ok off to the local Comcast office. After half hour in line I finally received my box but found out they changed our billing address to our vacation home address. They can't fix in office. Back to the phone. Took the box home and tried to hook up. They now tell me there are no such numbers. They are because they are on the back of their box no receipt. No appointment in days. Someone help me of this poor pathetic company!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1
Last year, we bought the Nascar In Car package from Comcast.  They charge you 99.00 for the season but half of the season it didn't work so I would sit on the phone pushing buttons waiting to speak to a human being and time I would get to speak to one they would have to turn off my box and reset it.  By this time the race is about half over. This year we started with speaking to a supervisor and talking to her about the problem she assured me that it should be better well guess what.....it's NOT working, and of course on the weekend when the race is on NOBODY is at work at Comcast.  But the will credit me $5.00.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1
I recently called Comcast just to activate internet only because I was going to go with DirecTV. The rep told me that I would pay less if I bundled internet and cable. I asked him to explain the packages to me which he did. He told me that I could get 75 Mbps plus 2 DVR's and one cable box all for $126.90 TOTAL including ALL fees. Guess what? Boxes came yesterday and internet is only 25 Mbps and my bill is $154. When I called CS, they told me that they are not responsible for what their rep discusses over the phone??? How is that possible? I was told that if I wanted 75 Mbps, there would be an extra fee of $10. I asked if they record the conversations and they said they did not know who I spoke with. This just doesn't seem right. If we aren't satisfied for any reason within 30 days, we can cancel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1
It is no wonder Comcast has such a terrible reputation. First person I spoke with was from the Philippines after spending over 15 grueling minutes on the phone as I had difficulty understanding the person who was trying to convince me the "Regional Sports Fee" was a state tax (which is B.S.). He said he would transfer me to someone who was fluent in English. The second person was even worse, I couldn't understand him at all. He transferred me to someone else, also with a foreign accent who finally transferred me to someone in Michigan who I could understand. That is 4 people I spoke with trying to get an answer.When I questioned the "Broadcast TV Fee" ($3.25 to $5.00, a 54% increase) and "Regional Sports Fee" ($4.25 to $8.00, a 88% increase) plus that I don't even like or listen to sports, but we have to pay a fee for something we don't use. She also tried to spin that it was a "government fee", more B.S. She then tried to explain it by saying Comcast costs are going up. Right. Please show me where Comcast costs are going up 54% or 88%. Perhaps increases in executive salaries and so-called athletes’ salaries are increasing that much. One of the reasons I don't watch sports is the ridiculous incomes the industry demands.Comcast is lying to and ripping its customers off not only by forcing a fee on many people who don't use that particular service but increasing the fees by exorbitant amounts and lying about the increase when the consumer price index is only going up 0.5% while average American wages & salaries are at 20 year lows!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1
This is sample of In-line Chat in August, 2010 with Comcast Live Support:"Me :I chatted yesterday with a support person because my phone lines went down. Today I can make a call but the conversation is clear than garbled. It comes and goes.Support : "You are most welcome. I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you. I will be more than willing to check on that for you. To ensure the integrity of your account information. May I please have the Full Account Name and complete home address? Also, please provide me your 16 digit account number or the last 4 digits of your Social Security Number."Then : Due to a network disruption, the message "2380" has not been sent. Please try again.After resending info, Support: Thank you. Please allow me to check on some notes here now. Allow me to pull up your account. Please allow me 2-3 minutes to run a diagnostics test, please take note that the services maybe interrupted as well when processing the tests.Me: I copied and pasted my conversation from yesterday if it helps. The support agent yesterday told me I would not have any more issues! And then :Well, I just lost phone service !Due to a network disruption, the message "well I just lost phone service! " has not been sent. Please try again.Support :Oh I see, That's fine.

On June 12, 2009, I found out that there was a notice put on my account by the inner office that will no longer allow me to make payment arrangements. No one could tell me why. All payment arrangements that I have made were honored and paid in full. Therefore, $116.00 was paid on June 13, 2009. To add injury to insult, my service was disconnected on June 26, 2009 without any notice. I was told by a customer service representative that I needed to pay my past due amount by the end of the day on June 26 or a technician would be out the next day to disconnect my service, which in turn could require me to pay a reconnection fee and the entire bill! Of course, I scrambled to make the payment of $129.00 before this predicament occurred knowing that I just made a payment two weeks prior without receiving a bill! The end total that I paid to Comcast for the month of June was $244.00! I would like to inquire why I can no longer make payment arrangements on my account. Is that policy? Comcast has a reputation for poor customer service and unfortunately I have been a victim of that. The economic damage resulted in me paying $244.00 with the course of two weeks. Customer service representatives were threatening to disconnect my service completely if I did not pay the amount due that same day! I have never been late on any payments or payment arrangements that I have set up!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
   This summer Comcast went to a new billing system. When I received my first "new bill", the charges were not correct.  They only charged me for the movies we had purchased from on demand.  I called Comcast to get the correct total and told them that I owed more than the bill stated.  The rep assured me that my bill was correct.  I spent 12 minutes (according to my cell phone records) trying to convince the rep the bill was wrong. I finally asked to to look at the bill and see how much I was charged for the cable service.  She said, oh, I see what you mean and asked me to hold.  When she came back she stated that my bill was indeed correct and that it was all I owed. I stated that that could not be and she stated they were having a "promotion".  I stated that I lived on a budget and did not want to get a big bill down the road and would she please see that my account was corrected. The next month the billing was still not right.  Again I called and tried to convince the rep my bill was wrong.  No, it's not.  That's all you owe I was told.  Again I stated that I did not want to get a big bill down the road. I was assured again that the amount stated on the bill was all that I owed. In September I got a bill for $295.16 for the services that had not been previously billed.  Again I called and asked why I was billed when I was told that I didn't owe anything other than what was on the billing statement.  I was told that there was a record I had called in but nothing about a problem with the billing.  I stated again that I could not pay this all at once and was assured that I could "take all the time I needed" to get the bill caught up. When my next statement came in it had a note that my service would be discontinued if the balance was not paid in full.  Once again, I called to explain the situation to the rep.  I was assured that my account would be flagged and that my service would not be interruped.  During this time I made weekly payments online to try to catch the bill up.  My service was interrupted.  This time I went on line to chat with a rep.  I explained the whole situation again and was told the bill had to be paid in full before service could be restored.  How could they turn off my service when it was their billing error, not mine, and I had made every effort to correct the situation.  All the rep had to do was look at my billing history to see that what I was saying was the truth. I managed to get the bill paid in full and now this month they have actually charged me late fees and collection charges.  Unbelievable.  Unfortunately I cannot discontinue service because my husband is disabled and he enjoys the free movies offered although we do purchase them occasionally.  We have been Comcast customers for years and years and usually purchase the baseball package every summer.  I don't know how they reps are being trained, but evidently it's just tell the customer what they want to hear and go on to the next.  I am extremely disappointed that Comcast would treat their customers this way.  If we ever are able to switch companies we will. The only damage was that I had to let other bills go in order to get our service restored for my husband since I had to pay the bill in full and not "take all the time I needed" to fix their error.

I called to see why my internet has been so slow lately for about the past month or two. They stated that if I want their 'new' high speed internet, then I will have to pay an additional $10 per month. From what I gathered from the person on the phone, they have recently slowed down their internet speed and are now charging for what used to be there basic high speed internet. I refuse to pay, but am concerned for all the others who are falling prey to this.They are charging $10 more for what was once part of their high speed internet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1
We were sent a new box to update our internet connection. We spent over 2 hours on the phone trying to get it to work. We spoke to 3 different people - two of whom were very difficult to understand. The other was a very grumpy woman. They never could get it to work and decided the modem is defective. Their solution to the problem was to say that we had to take the box to the Comcast store. The only way they would send a technician was if we paid for the visit and even then they said he would not bring a box, we would still have to get a new one ourselves. We are exploring our other options for Internet connection.
